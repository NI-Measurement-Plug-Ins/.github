# So You Want To Develop A MeasurementLink Plugin
1. Create a new repository starting from the [template](https://github.com/NI-MeasurementLink-Plug-Ins/measlink-repo-template).
2. Add a description to your new repo so others will know what it is all about.
3. Set up branch protection rules like require approvals for PRs and linear history. For more, check out GitHub's [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
4. Write some code and share it in your new repo.
5. Add documentation so others know how to use it as well as develop with it.
6. Create a NI Package of your compiled measurement service and create a Release so others can use it as is.
7. Consider adding your release to this org's NI Package Feed [repo](https://github.com/NI-MeasurementLink-Plug-Ins/package-manager-feeds) so users can automatically get updates in NI Package Manager.
